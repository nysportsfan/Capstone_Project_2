    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the common problems that the everyday American faces is their financial situation. There are many different reasons for this, such as debt, student loans, the passing of a parent. According to a study of 1000 Americans over the age of 30 (conducted by GuideVine), less than half of Americans understood common financial concepts such as interest, bankruptcy, and inflation. More importantly, more than half felt \"lost\" when it came to having a secure long-term plan for their financial future. This highlights a re-occuring theme in our society where many people have trouble getting by with their finances and naturally some people seek help online. One of these resources is a subreddit called 'Personal Finance', which is hosted on the popular discussion-board website **Reddit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![s](https://github.com/nysportsfan/Personal_Finance_Subreddit/blob/master/Images/PersonalFinance%20Subreddit%20Screenshot.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "**/r/personalfinance** has become a place where many people are able to ask for help regarding their financial situations. A few common topics are savings, budgeting, taxes and debt. There are hundreds of different posts everyday from people of different ages, genders, locations and occupations. Frequent users of the subreddit often provide advice through comments and are able to upvote posts to help it gain more visibility on the front page of /r/personalfinance. However, the main feature we will be focusing on in this project is the \"flair\" feature which enables users to tag their submissions with a topic. For example, if I wrote a post asking advice on paying off my student loans, I would use the 'Debt' flair. This helps organize the hundreds of daily posts into different categories so that people will be able to search them more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 main problems with this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Not all users choose a flair for their post**. In this scenario, the system will automatically tag the post with 'Other', which is used when the user either doesn't know what topic the post should fall under OR if the user does not assign a topic. This becomes a problem since this can result in many posts not having their proper flair and ruins the organized structure of searching by topic. The 'Other' flair was originally designed to contain posts that did not fall under the other topics but due to the popularity of /r/PersonalFinance (over 13 million subscribers), there are often many new users who do not how to either assign a topic (issue with the interface) or choose a topic (unfamiliar with financial categories). Because of this, the 'Other' flair is usually the most popular and common topic on the subreddit despite the fact that most of the posts actually do fall under another topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "It would be like someone throwing their plastic trash into a regular garbage bin instead of the recycle bin because they were unaware of what the recycle bin is for, they did not see it, or they did not care to throw it into the proper bin. If this was simply a rarity, it could be overlooked but if it becomes a common occurence, it would create a larger problem that would need to be remedied quickly. The same logic applies for properly flairing a post rather than leaving it to 'Other'. \n",
    "\n",
    "![s](http://ahs.mcnairycountyschools.com/uploads/5/2/7/9/52798193/9759366_orig.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **There are posts which fit under multiple topics**. Each post can only have a single flair thus forcing users to decide which topic best represents their question or idea. However this can have several repercussions. First, the way a user decides on the topic is very subjective and may not be the best fit. Second, if they don't know which topic to pick for their post, they may decide to simply classify it under 'Other', which goes back to the first problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) **The current set of available topics may not be the best variety or most efficient**. This is a more interesting problem and can be an analytical problem for another project because it is difficult to ascertain how efficient it is to use the current batch of flairs. One question is whether we should add more topics in order to reduce the number of 'Other' posts and to also make it easier for users to identify the proper flair for their submissions. For example, should we include a new 'Student' topic for questions pertaining to student loans, textbook savings, getting a campus job, etc. Another question is whether or not we can *remove* any of the current topics and replace it with something else. This is not to say that the current topics are bad; in fact, using an eye-test would be enough for most people to be satisfied with them but how do we know whether or not they are the most efficient set of topics? \n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up these 3 main problems into a single question: **How can we create an efficient set of topics and automatically assign a single one for each post?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will consist of 4 stages to tackle this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Data Acquisition**: This is often the most important step in any data science project. We will first need to acquire the relevant data from /r/personalfinance. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Data Wrangling**: After we extract the data, we will need to clean it and prepare it for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Exploratory Data Analysis**: We will begin to explore the data and observe any interesting trends that can provide a direction or foundation for how we proceed with the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4) Machine Learning**: Let us split the problem statement into 2 parts: First, can we create topics based on the posts' text and assign one to each post? Second, how do we determine whether or not these topics are efficient? We will be applying various machine learning techniques to answer both questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Clients\n",
    "\n",
    " - 1) **/r/PersonalFinance Users** will be interested in having a new system that could automatically determine a proper topic for their submission so that they don't have to choose one themselves. Whether they are too lazy, don't know which topic to select This will also help other people who search posts by topic. For example, if someone was interested in reading advice for people struggling with low income, they could simply navigate through the 'Planning' topic. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - 2) **/r/PersonalFinance Moderators** will benefit from having a clearer structure for all submissions. Many of the popular subreddits insist on their members tagging their posts with flairs because of the convenience and organization it provides to the subreddit as a whole (sometimes this is even a requirement). One of the problems that moderators face with their subreddits is the influx of re-occuring questions. Many subreddits will ask users to first search for similar posts before submitting their own because it helps to reduce the number of the same posed questions. By having a better topic system, this will help the search feature because there will be fewer 'Other' posts and more of the specific topics. "

    "## 1. Data Acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Obtaining the data**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this report, I created my own dataset through 2 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**First**, we extract the submission information using the pushshift.io Reddit API (https://github.com/pushshift/api). It gives us the ability to search through Reddit data and create data aggregations. Using sqlite was necessary as there are many different rows of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before beginning, we must specify the date ranges for which we wanted to extract the data. This is important so that we can attach the date ranges to the pushshift url. For example, if we wanted to extract the newest post submissions as of August 25th for /r/nba (a subreddit for fans of the National Basketball Association), we would first convert August 25th 11:59 PM into datetime format and then into a timestamp using the .timetuple() method. We then add the subreddit and timestamp as strings in the url. \n",
    "\n",
    "This would be the resulting url: http://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/submission/?subreddit=personalfinance&size=500&before=1535255999\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a quick look!\n",
    "\n",
    "![s](https://github.com/nysportsfan/Personal_Finance_Subreddit/blob/master/Images/Pushshift%20IO%20Example.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this will provide the 500 most recent posts as of August 25th 11:59PM because we specified size = 500. We then use the requests module to use its builtin JSON decoder and extract the relevant data from each pull. To get the next 500 most recent posts, we simply create another pull by replacing the timestamp such that it comes right after the date and time of the 500th post. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Second**, I used the official Reddit API to extract information that is not provided through the pushshift.io Reddit API. In this case, we extracted the flair information (which will act as the \"topics\" of each submission). The reason we cannot simply use the official Reddit API to extract all the submission data is because they limit the number of submissions (1000) you are allowed to extract as well as the date range.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we extract the 1000 most recent posts on a subreddit, we cannot extract the next 1000 most recent posts since we cannot specify the date range.\n",
    "Due to the extremely taxing and computationally expensive length of this procedure, we will have a dataset that contains approximately 100,000 rows of data. Each row represents a submission in the Personal Finance subreddit. The features will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- title\n",
    "\n",
    "- date (the date at which the post was submitted)\n",
